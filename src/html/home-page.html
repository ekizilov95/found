            Over the years, you may have been told that the only way to lose weight is to eat less and work out more. 
            For most Americans, however, these techniques clearly aren’t working.
          </p> 
          <p>
            According to the CDC, 70% of the United States population is classified as overweight or obese, and that number is on the rise. 
            Obesity is a medical problem, that is driven by biology, psychology, and social elements. Torch has developed a bio-psycho-social approach to address all of these elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Torch members are provided with a highly personalized and all-encompassing weight loss program that combines prescription medication, 1:1 health coaching and a supportive community in order to guide them towards and maintain a healthy weight. 
            Here’s why we think Torch is the best way to see if prescription medication can kickstart your weight loss journey.

            “So many individuals spend years trying different diet and exercise plans to help them lose weight but often to no avail. 
            These other programs ignore the biological contributors to weight gain. Torch is based on your biology and is backed by science.”

                  <p>Prescription weight loss medication can be an extremely effective weight loss tool. However, it is important to find the correct medication for you. Different medications counteract different causes of unhealthy weight. </p>
                  <p>For example, some medications work to reduce cravings while others work to speed up your metabolism. For this reason, Torch members fill out an extremely detailed health questionnaire that enables board-certified doctors to pinpoint and prescribe exactly which medications and dosage will result in sustainable, long-term weight loss. </p>
                  <p>Torch doctors are not trying to sell one specific medication over another, but are simply trying to find the right medication based on your biology. </p>
